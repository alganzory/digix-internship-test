# Welcome to My digi-x internship technical test submission!

Hi! I'm Mohamed Mustafa Mahmoud Elganzory and this is my submission for digi-x internship technical assessment. 


## Section 1

A typical Restaurant reservation system should allow users to simply and easily reserve table(s) at the restaurant at a given time and date. It should also have an admin dashboard for the restaurant to be able to view and manage the reservations. For that, the system UI should be smooth and intuitive and the backend needs to be fast and secure. There are many web frameworks that can get the job done but these  my choices for the stack, these choices are mainly based on tech I have used before because that would be the fastest way to get started on such a project.

1- Frontend: **HTML, CSS, React js, React-admin, p5.js and TailwindCSS.**
React.js, in my opinion, in my opinion and experience is great for interactive interfaces that also has a huge community support. It would also be a good choice along with React-admin to build a minimal and easy admin dashboard for the restaurant to manage their reservations. On the customer side, I will use p5.js to present the tables and time slots in a creative drawings style and p5.js is great for that. TailwindCSS is also great to provide utility CSS classes for quick development.

2- Backend:  **Node.js + Express.js** to develop the API endpoints to be consumed by the client app and react-admin. Node.js is great for small and medium size applications, in my experience, and it's fairly easy and quick to set up a working server and API. 

3- Database Manager: **MySQL** would be my choice for a relational SQL database as it's an industry standard, and it's fairly easy to setup and use with Node.js.


## Section 2

*1. What is version control and why is it important?*
Version control refers to tracking and managing the history of a code repository as time passes, it also allows teams to collaborate together on a codebase. It's crucial for software projects to be able to track changes in the code base and be able to go back and forth between them. It's also vital among teams where multiple people can work on the same codebase without affecting the main code by utilizing branching strategies. 

*2. List a few version control software available that is commonly used by developers*
Most developers use Git as the main version control software and use in combination to it some remote version control apps like Github, Gitlab or Bitbucket. 

*3. How would this version control software help developers?*
Version control helps developers keep track of changes done to a code base over time, it also helps them collaborate and work on different or even same parts of the code without losing track of the original state of the code. It allows developers to work on different branches and then merge their code whenever it's ready.
